Overview
API testing focuses on analyzing and validating RESTful or SOAP endpoints for functionality, security, and robustness. Using Burp Suite Professional, testers can intercept, manipulate, and automate attacks against API endpoints to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

Phases of API Testing in Burp Suite Professional
1. Reconnaissance and Preparation
Objective: Understand the structure, behavior, and documentation of the API.

Key Actions:

Analyze the application flow to identify API calls.

Collect API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI/Postman collections) if available.

Identify HTTP methods, headers, request/response formats.

Capture API calls using Burp's Proxy by routing browser or mobile app traffic through Burp.

Burp Tools Used:

Target tab (for endpoint discovery)

Proxy tab (to intercept requests)

Logger (to monitor all requests)

2. Manual Exploration and Baseline Behavior
Objective: Understand how the API behaves under normal use.

Key Actions:

Send requests to Repeater for manual manipulation and testing.

Vary parameters, headers, and request types.

Observe status codes, error messages, and data returned.

Explore access control: test endpoints as unauthenticated, authenticated, and with role variations.

Burp Tools Used:

Repeater (for request replay)

Target > Site Map (for endpoint mapping)

3. Authentication and Session Handling Analysis
Objective: Test the strength and implementation of authentication and session management.

Key Actions:

Identify tokens (JWT, session IDs, API keys) in headers or URL.

Test for token reuse, expiration, and rotation.

Remove or tamper with tokens to test unauthorized access.

Attempt token forging or manipulation (JWT tampering).

Burp Tools Used:

Repeater

Decoder (for encoding/decoding tokens)

Intruder (for brute force attacks on login or API keys)

4. Input Validation and Parameter Tampering
Objective: Test how the API handles malformed, malicious, or unexpected input.

Key Actions:

Inject payloads into parameters (query, JSON body, headers, path).

Test for SQL injection, command injection, XSS (if reflected in API responses).

Observe how API handles empty, missing, long, or special-character inputs.

Burp Tools Used:

Repeater (for manual testing)

Intruder (for automated fuzzing)

Logger or Proxy (to monitor changes)

5. Authorization Testing
Objective: Validate whether users can access only what they are authorized to.

Key Actions:

Test horizontal privilege escalation (accessing other users' data).

Test vertical privilege escalation (accessing admin endpoints as a user).

Remove or manipulate role identifiers or object IDs.

Burp Tools Used:

Repeater (for request replay with altered tokens or IDs)

Comparer (to compare responses)

6. Rate Limiting and DoS Testing
Objective: Check if APIs are protected against abuse or DoS-style attacks.

Key Actions:

Send multiple repeated requests to the same endpoint.

Observe if API starts throttling or blocking requests.

Vary headers or tokens to bypass naive rate limits.

Burp Tools Used:

Intruder (for timed bursts of requests)

Repeater with macros or extensions (for scripting)

7. Security Misconfigurations and Vulnerability Testing
Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in how the API is configured or deployed.

Key Actions:

Check for verbose error messages or stack traces.

Look for exposed internal endpoints or test/debug routes.

Scan for known issues using Burp Scanner.

Use Active Scan on specific endpoints after manual verification.

Burp Tools Used:

Scanner (for active/passive scans)

Extensions like:

JWT Editor (for JWT fuzzing)

Autorize (for authorization bypass testing)

Param Miner (for hidden parameters)

Logger++ (advanced logging)

8. Post-Testing Review and Reporting
Objective: Document findings, map impacted endpoints, and assess overall API posture.

Key Actions:

Consolidate findings from Repeater, Scanner, Logger, and Target tabs.

Prioritize vulnerabilities by severity and exploitability.

Provide detailed proof of concept (PoC) with request/response pairs.

Suggest remediation strategies for each finding.

Common Vulnerabilities to Look For
Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

Broken Authentication

Excessive Data Exposure

Lack of Rate Limiting

Mass Assignment

Security Misconfiguration

Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command)

Improper Error Handling

Tips for Efficient API Testing
Always test both authenticated and unauthenticated access.

Test with and without required headers.

Automate repetitive testing with Burp extensions.

Monitor both request and response sizes for anomalies.

Use external wordlists (SecLists, OWASP) with Intruder.

Sample Workflow
Start Burp Suite and configure Proxy.

Browse the application or use the API client to generate traffic.

Send interesting requests to Repeater for testing.

Use Intruder for fuzzing parameters or brute-forcing endpoints.

Run targeted scans using Scanner.

Document results with clear request/response evidence.
