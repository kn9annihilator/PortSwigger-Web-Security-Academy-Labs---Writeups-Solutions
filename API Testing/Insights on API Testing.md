Insights on API Testing Labs on PortSwigger

PortSwigger’s API Testing labs, part of the Web Security Academy, offer hands-on exercises to help learners understand and test for security vulnerabilities in web APIs. These labs simulate real-world scenarios and focus specifically on how attackers can exploit insecure implementations of RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

Here is a detailed overview of what these labs offer and the key concepts they cover:

1. Purpose and Structure
The API Testing labs are designed to:

Teach common API vulnerabilities.

Provide an environment to practice exploiting those vulnerabilities.

Encourage secure coding practices by understanding how flaws are introduced.

Each lab includes:

A brief explanation of the vulnerability.

A target application with the flaw.

A goal or flag to achieve (such as accessing unauthorized data).

2. Key Areas Covered
a. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
These labs show how APIs fail to enforce proper authorization checks on object IDs (like user IDs), allowing attackers to access or manipulate other users’ data.

Lab example: Accessing another user’s account by changing the ID in the API request.

b. Broken User Authentication
Labs demonstrate weaknesses in token-based authentication, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), API key leaks, and misconfigurations.

Focus areas include:

Predictable tokens

JWT signature validation bypass

API keys exposed in URLs or headers

c. Excessive Data Exposure
Some APIs return more data than necessary, trusting the client to filter it. Labs show how attackers can extract sensitive information from overly verbose responses.

d. Lack of Rate Limiting
These labs explore how APIs without rate limits can be abused through brute-force attacks or enumeration techniques.

Example: Attempting thousands of password guesses or ID values.

e. Mass Assignment
Labs teach how attackers can manipulate request payloads to modify server-side properties they shouldn't be able to access.

Technique example: Adding unexpected fields to a POST request to escalate privileges.

f. Injection Attacks
Similar to traditional web apps, APIs are also vulnerable to injection attacks like SQL, NoSQL, and command injection.

Labs demonstrate:

How input passed through an API can be manipulated to run malicious queries.

API endpoints lacking proper sanitization.

g. Security Misconfiguration
Labs highlight real-world misconfigurations such as:

Exposed Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

Insecure CORS settings

Directory traversal via API endpoints

3. Tools and Techniques Practiced
Burp Suite: The labs are integrated with Burp Suite, allowing users to intercept, modify, and replay API traffic.

Manual Testing: Learners use manual inspection to discover and exploit flaws.

Automation Concepts: While automation isn’t the main focus, the labs build foundational knowledge needed for scripting API attacks using tools or custom scripts.

4. Importance for Security Testers
Mastering these labs helps testers:

Understand API architecture and how vulnerabilities arise.

Learn how attackers think when targeting APIs.

Gain practical skills applicable in bug bounties, pentests, and secure development.

5. Prerequisites
Basic understanding of HTTP and REST APIs.

Familiarity with request methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Some experience using Burp Suite is helpful but not mandatory.
